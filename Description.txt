This wizard aims to help hospital workers in accepting new patients into the hospital and keep track of equipment and medicines required.

Source data is included and consists of:
	- main excel tracker (Main Beds Tracker - stored.xlsx) - list of all beds and patients currently accepted
	- helpers data (Illness data.xlsx) - data about diseases handled by a hospital, equipment and medicines available in a hospital
	- configuration file (configuration.json) - file that stores configurable settings of the wizard

Additionally source code of bed assigning .net plugin is attached ("plugin.zip").

How to make the wizard run on new machine:
1. Specify path to "configuration.json" file in $Generic_ExternalConfigFilePath$ (see "Configuration_1.png")
2. Set paths to "main excel tracker" and "helpers data" in "configuration.json" file. Use double backslash (see Configuration_2.png)
3. Run the wizard

Functionalities:
1. Add new patient to tracker and assign bed automatically. This process is designed in such way that patient with contagious disease must be alone in a room. If automatic process fails it is a human judgement which bed should be assigned to new patient. Each patient has also information about equipment and medicines required.
2. Mask patient information. It is possible to mask patient personal information (name and address) when adding a patient. To enable this feature please set "useMasking" to "TRUE" in "configuration.json (see "Enable_Masking.png")
3. Edit patient information (medicines and equipment required). It is possible to edit medicines and equipment selected when adding new patient
4. Discharge patient. This will make a bed occupied by a patient available again.
5. Detailed logs. This wizard saves logs during runtime to help investigate potential issues. See "Example_Logs.png" for a sneak peak. By default those logs are located in "C:\Kryon Activity Logs". To change this location please adjust variables in Step 1: $Logger_LogsFolderName$ and $Logger_LogsParentFolderPath$ (see "Logger_Configuration.png")
